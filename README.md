# climatespiral
"Climate spiral" visualisation of monthly global mean temperature anomalies.

[Climate spirals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_spiral)
were first created by [Ed Hawkins](https://ed-hawkins.github.io/climate-visuals/spirals.html).
For Earth Day 2023, [Dan Shiffman](https://twitter.com/shiffman)
of [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com)
made a [video](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/178-climate-spiral)
in which he programmed a climate spiral in [p5\*js](https://p5js.org).
This is my version of the same.

Data downloaded from [NASA Goddard](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)
labeled as "Global-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means, 1880-present, updated through most recent month".
